# I moved to https://codeberg.org/LDprg

This is mostly due to GH Actions, AI, Microsoft, Githubs links to ICE, no actual improvments, bad pricings, etc. (Very much the same reasons [zig](https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/) moved). If you are interesed just look up the internet there are more than one reason to switch.

Since my gh profile is quite old now I most likely won't move all of my old code to codeberg (this means non maintained stuff or small/big fun projects).
All my new ones will be found there and old ones I activly develop from now on, each repo get a title that indicates it got moved and will be archived.

# If you care about OpenSource move away from Github too!
